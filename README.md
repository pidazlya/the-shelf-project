{
  id: number,          // Unique timestamp ID
  title: string,       // Book title
  author: string,      // Author name
  year: number,        // Publication year
  category: string,    // Book category
  cover: string,       // Cover URL (optional)
  isComplete: boolean  // true if finished reading
}
